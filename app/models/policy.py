"""
Policy model definition.

This module defines the data models that represent access and usage
policies in the Eclipse Data Connector (EDC) ecosystem. Policies are
based on the ODRL (Open Digital Rights Language) specification and
describe permissions, prohibitions, and obligations that regulate
how data can be used and shared between connectors.

The models follow a hierarchical structure:
- Operator: defines the comparison operator in a constraint.
- Constraint: specifies a condition (e.g., leftOperand, operator, rightOperand).
- Rule: represents a single permission, prohibition, or obligation.
- PolicyDefinition: groups rules into a complete ODRL policy.
- Policy: top-level model that associates a policy definition with a specific EDC.
